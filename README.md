# Car_Number_Plate_Recognition

This project aims to develop a robust and efficient system for automatically recognizing license plates on vehicles. The system computer vision and machine learning techniques to accurately extract license plate information from images and videos.



### License Plate Detection: 
The system can detect and locate license plates within images or video frames.
### Character Segmentation:
After plate detection, the system segments individual characters on the license plate for accurate recognition.
### License Plate Recognition:
Utilizing deep learning models, the system recognizes the alphanumeric characters on the license plate.


### How to use
1. Launch the application by running main.py.
2. Input images or video streams containing vehicles with visible license plates.
3. View the real-time license plate detection and recognition results.
